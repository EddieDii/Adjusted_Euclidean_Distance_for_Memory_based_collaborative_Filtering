This is the assignment 3 of data science with python.
### Introduction
In this assignment, you are given a specific data science problem and one (more) potential solution(s). You are required to implement the (these) solution(s), then complete the required tasks (as detailed below) successfully.
### Overview

Although k nearest neighbour (KNN) (also known as memory-based) based Collaborative Filtering method has been proved to be very successful, it still faces some challenges, including the estimation of similarity between users or items. Luckily, data scientists and researchers have been working hard to further improve the k nearest neighbour based Collaborative Filtering method.

Specifically, an existing solution is proposed to further improve KNN-based Collab- orative method by using Euclidean Distance. This existing solution is presented in a report named “A New Similarity Measure Based on Adjusted Euclidean Distance for Memory-based Collaborative Filtering”. Please read this report carefully, then complete the following tasks.
